# IJ-Retinex
an implementation of the Retinex filter from the GIMP package. Retinex filtering is based on Land's theory of image perception.  Several algorithms exist and among these the multiscale retinex with colour restoration algorithm (MSRCR) combines colour constancy with local contrast enhancement so images are rendered in a similar way to the colour perception of the human vision.  plugin was written by Francisco Jiménez Hernández (UAEMex)  during a research visit to Birmingham University, School of Dentistry.
